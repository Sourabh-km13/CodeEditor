## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, Zustand, Tailwind CSS, Monaco Editor
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, Docker, Socket.IO, child_process (`exec`)
- **Terminal**: xterm.js with WebSocket integration
- **Editor**: Monaco Editor with real-time editing support

## üîç How It Works

1. **Create Playground**
   - User clicks the `Create Playground` button on the homepage.
   - Backend runs `npm create vite@latest` using Node's `child_process.exec`.
   - A new project is scaffolded and user is redirected to `/editor`.

2. **Load Project Tree**
   - The file structure is read and sent to the frontend using Express APIs.
   - Zustand manages the global state for files and directories.

3. **Real-time Terminal**
   - WebSocket (`socket.io`) connects frontend to backend.
   - Terminal commands are executed in an isolated Node.js Docker container.

4. **Code and Run**
   - Monaco Editor provides rich code editing.
   - User can install packages, run dev server, and manage code live from the browser.
